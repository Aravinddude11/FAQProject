                Do I need to be a math genius to learn data structures and algorithms?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                While a basic understanding of mathematics is helpful, you don't need to be a math expert to learn data structures and algorithms. Most concepts can be understood with basic mathematical reasoning. Focus on understanding the logic and application of each concept rather than getting bogged down by complex mathematical formulas.
